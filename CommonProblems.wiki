== Debug mode can cause a Javascript error ==

Debug mode uses the [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/trunk/min/lib/Minify/Lines.php Minify_Lines] class to add line numbers in comments. Unfortunately, if the source file has a string or regex containing (what looks like) a C-style comment token, the algorithm is confused and the injected comments cause a syntax error. If you prefer not to alter your source file, [http://code.google.com/p/minify/issues/detail?id=55#c7 issue 55] has a few simple workarounds until this is patched.

== Minification can cause a Javascript error ==

In rare instances the [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/tags/release_2.1.1/min/lib/JSMin.php#14 JSMin] algorithm can be confused by regexes in certain contexts and throw an exception. The current workaround is to simply wrap the expression in parenthesis. E.g.
{{{
return /'/;   // JSMin throws error

return (/'/); // no error
}}}
[http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/trunk/min/lib/MyMin.php Andrea Giammarchi's extension of JSMin] resolves this issue, and we're working to merge that fix into our JSMin.

== Incorrect DOCUMENT_ROOT settings ==

If `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']` is invalid, e.g. contains a trailing slash "/", or points to a path that doesn't exist, Minify will not work correctly. If you cannot fix this in httpd.conf, etc., [http://code.google.com/p/minify/issues/detail?id=68#c6 Issue 68] has a simple workaround that may appear in a future Minify release.
