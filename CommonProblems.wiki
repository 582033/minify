== @imports can appear in invalid locations in combined CSS files ==

If you combine CSS files, @import declarations can appear after CSS rules, invalidating the stylesheet. As of version 2.1.2, if Minify detects this, it will prepend a warning to the output CSS file. To resolve this, you can either move your @import statements within your files, or enable the option 'bubbleCssImports'.

== An incorrect DOCUMENT_ROOT can cause problems ==

If `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']` is invalid, e.g. contains a trailing slash "/", or points to a path that doesn't exist, Minify may not work correctly. If you cannot fix this in httpd.conf, etc., version 2.1.2 added a configuration option to specify the document root.

== Debug mode can cause a Javascript error ==

This issue was resolved in version 2.1.2.

Debug mode adds line numbers in comments. Unfortunately, in versions <= 2.1.1, if the source file had a string or regex containing (what looks like) a C-style comment token, the algorithm was confused and the injected comments caused a syntax error.

== Minification can cause a Javascript error ==

This issue was resolved in version 2.1.2.

In rare instances the [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/tags/release_2.1.1/min/lib/JSMin.php#14 JSMin] algorithm in versions <= 2.1.1 could be confused by regexes in certain contexts and throw an exception. The workaround was to simply wrap the expression in parenthesis. E.g.
{{{
return /'/;   // JSMin in 2.1.1 throws error

return (/'/); // no error
}}}
