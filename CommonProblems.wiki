== Debug mode can cause a Javascript error ==

Debug mode uses the [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/trunk/min/lib/Minify/Lines.php Minify_Lines] class to add line numbers in comments. Unfortunately, if the source file has a string or regex containing (what looks like) a C-style comment token, the algorithm is confused and the injected comments cause a syntax error. If you prefer not to alter your source file, [http://code.google.com/p/minify/issues/detail?id=55#5 issue 55] has a simple workaround that removes the line numbers from debug mode.

== Minification can cause a Javascript error ==

In rare instances the [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/tags/release_2.1.1/min/lib/JSMin.php#14 JSMin] algorithm can be confused by regexes in certain contexts and throw an exception. The current workaround is to simply wrap the expression in parenthesis. E.g.
{{{
return /'/;   // JSMin throws error

return (/'/); // no error
}}}
[http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/trunk/min/lib/MyMin.php Andrea Giammarchi's extension of JSMin] resolves this issue, and we're working to merge that fix into our JSMin.
