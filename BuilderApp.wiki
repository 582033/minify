#summary The URI Builder that comes with Minify
#labels Phase-Support

Minify ships with "Builder", a simple Javascript app for constructing URIs to use with Minify. ([http://www.mrclay.org/index.php/2008/09/19/minify-21-on-mrclayorg/ screenshots of the 2.1.0 version])

It also does some run-time checks of your PHP and Minify configuration to look for problematic settings like [http://code.google.com/p/minify/wiki/CommonProblems#Output_is_distorted/random_chars auto-encoding].

After installation, this is found at *`http://example.com/min/builder/`*

If you want to disable it, open `min/config.php` and set: `$min_enableBuilder = false;`
