= Installing Minify for the first time =

[http://code.google.com/p/minify/downloads/list Download] the latest Minify and unzip the files to a new "minify" directory.

Copy the "min" folder directly into your DOCUMENT_ROOT.

Done!

(Optional) See TestingMinify if you'd like to run unit tests.

== Upgrading Minify from 2.1.x ==

See the [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/tags/release_2.1.2/UPGRADING.txt Upgrade Guide]

= Usage =

Browse to http://example.com/min/

The Minify URI Builder will help you create URIs you can use to minify existing files on your site. You can see screenshots and get a feel for this process from this [http://mrclay.org/index.php/2008/09/19/minify-21-on-mrclayorg/ walkthrough on mrclay.org]

= Configuration =

Most configuration options are located in [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/trunk/min/config.php min/config.php]. To set up groups of files to minify, this can specified in [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/trunk/min/groupsConfig.php min/groupsConfig.php] (The builder application will help with this).

= Problems? =

See CommonProblems and [Debugging]. You might also try TestingMinify (and running `test_environment.php` in particular).
