= Installing Minify for the first time =

[http://code.google.com/p/minify/downloads/list Download] the latest Minify and unzip the files to a new "minify" directory.

Copy the "min" folder directly into your DOCUMENT_ROOT.

Done!

(Optional) See TestingMinify if you'd like to run unit tests.

== Upgrading Minify from 2.1.x ==

See the [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/tags/release_2.1.2/UPGRADING.txt Upgrade Guide]

= Usage =

Browse to http://example.com/min/

The Minify URI Builder will help you create URIs you can use to minify existing files on your site. You can see screenshots and get a feel for this process from this [http://mrclay.org/index.php/2008/09/19/minify-21-on-mrclayorg/ walkthrough on mrclay.org]

Browse to [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/tags/release_2.1.3/min/README.txt http://example.com/min/README.txt] for more complete documentation.

= Configuration =

[http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/trunk/min/config.php min/config.php] holds general config options.

[http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/trunk/min/groupsConfig.php min/groupsConfig.php] holds preset groups of files to minify. (The builder application can help with this).

CookBook shows how to customize settings between production/development environments, and between groups.

CustomSource shows how to set some file/source-specific options, or serve content from a PHP script or URL.

= Problems? =

See CommonProblems and [Debugging]. You might also try TestingMinify (running `test_environment.php` in particular).
