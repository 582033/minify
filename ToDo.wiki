=== performance testing ===

  * setup script to run ab tests of example setups

My main performance concern is the use of require_once's. With every call we're at least including Source.php, Controller/Base.php, the controller in use, and ConditionalGet.php. Non-conditional GETs (most on a popular site) will also usually include the cache class(es) and Encoder.php, so we're up to 7 files called per resource hit.

The structure is obviously more maintainable/extensible, but what if integrating all those files into one (for, say, the Groups controller usage) greatly improved performance?

Obviously using PHP to serve files is never going to get you near native server speed. Minify is a quick shortcut.
