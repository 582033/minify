#New code in SVN

= Version 2 =

If you check the [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/trunk trunk], you'll see a completely new Minify in the works. 

This version is built upon a library of classes allowing users to easily build customized minified-file servers; or add minification, HTTP encoding, or [http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers conditional GET] to existing projects. It will release with a v1-compatible minify.php script to ease upgrades, but also complete example sites to show its flexibility.

I encourage you to [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/checkout checkout] the new version, run the tests, and see the code for Example 1 to get an idea of usage. 

The individual files have docs, but proper documentation will come in time. The [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/trunk/README README] has a bit more info.
