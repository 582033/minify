== How fast is it? ==

With Minify you will ideally serve _fewer_ requests, but Minify can be slower than your HTTPd serving flat files. If you have a high-traffic site with hundreds of simultaneous requests from new users, you should probably:

  * Place your HTTPd behind a [http://www.squid-cache.org/Intro/why.dyn reverse proxy], which can cache Minify URLs and serve them _fast_.
  * Benchmark Minify on your development server before rolling out to production.
  * Use [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/tags/release_2.1.0/min/README.txt#69 predefined groups] and the [http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/tags/release_2.1.0/min/utils.php#11 Minify_groupUri()] utility function (or some other method) to revision your URIs. Minify will automatically send far-off Expires headers.

=== Will it get faster? ===

Ideally. For Apache users we're designing a feature to enable [http://mrclay.org/index.php/2008/05/25/apache-http-encoding-negotiation-notes/ minified and pre-encoded files to be served directly from the HTTPd]. Requests will not execute PHP at all and be blazingly fast. Even if you're not minifying files this will be faster than serving files with Apache's mod_deflate.

== How does it compare with other services? ==

Yahoo's [http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/07/16/combohandler/ Combo Handler] and Google's [http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/ AJAX Libraries API] both serve content from their heavy-duty [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Delivery_Network CDN]s and _potentially_ increase the chance that your visitor will already have a file in her browser cache. Neither service serves custom content that you provide. You may wish to use these services to serve popular libraries and Minify to serve your code.

== Does it support gzip compression? ==

Yes. Based on the browser's Accept-Encoding header, Minify will serve content encoded with deflate or gzip.

== Does it work with PHP opcode caches like APC and eAccelerator? ==

Yes!

== Is there a minifier for HTML? ==

[http://code.google.com/p/minify/source/browse/trunk/min/lib/Minify/HTML.php Yes], and it can even minify embedded STYLE and SCRIPT elements. Since Minify_HTML is not fast, the best time to use it is when storing HTML; e.g., in a DB keep one copy for editing and one minified for serving.

Minify is not suited for _serving_ HTML pages on a site, though it can be done for small numbers of static pages.

== How does it ensure that the client can't request files it shouldn't have access to? ==

In 2.1, by default, Minify allows files to be specified using the URI, or using pre-configured sets of files.

With URI-specified files, Minify serves only ".css" and ".js" files, and only from a configurable set of allowable directories within the DOCUMENT_ROOT. It cannot know if you've configured your web server to protect an otherwise public directory (e.g. with .htaccess); a sneaky user can request .js/.css files from this directory if he/she guesses the path!

An included option can disable URI-specified files so Minify will serve only the pre-configured file sets.

== Is it used in production by any large-scale websites? ==

It appears http://lifehacker.com/ and other [http://gawker.com/ Gawker]-related sites use Minify 1.x, but I can't say for certain. There are probably a lot of smaller sites using it. E.g. http://mrclay.org/ and http://www.miamianimalremoval.com/

== Can I use it with my commercial website or product? ==

Yes.
